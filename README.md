KOTORModSync
KOTORModSync is a multi-mod installer for KOTOR games that makes it easier to install and manage mods. I created this the day that in 3 separate attempts I failed a different step in a modbuild install. Going through the manual install and getting anxious when an instruction could be ambiguous or have multiple meanings. I usually install the modbuild every year or so. the last time I did so I made a mistake on a single different step 3 times in a row and had to start over for each. So I decided to build a tool to simplify the process.

Goals
The main goal of this project is to not be some dead attempt that requires significant changes to a hard-to-understand configuration file. In order to do that, KOTORModSync can create and load a configuration file which provides instructions and specific mods dynamically. It also will include SHA1 validation to prevent errors during installation.

Platforms
KOTORModSync is compatible with Windows7-11, Ubuntu, and Mac, as well as anything supported by .net standard 2.0.
